  **Describe cloud computing

    - Microsoft Azure: cloud computing platform. 

    - Cloud computing: Delivery of computing services over the internet.
      - Includes: virtual machines, storage, databases, networking.
      - Delivery over internet -> not constrained by physical infrastructure.
        - Easy expansion.

  **Describe the shared responsibility
    
    - Responsibility shared between cloud provider and consumer
      - Maintanance, security, infrastructure, software.

    - Cloud provider responsible for:
      - Physical security, power, cooling, network connectivity

    - Consumer responsible for: 
      - The data and information stored in the cloud. 
      - Access security

    - Responsibility depends on the situation/cloud service types.

    *Cloud service types (X as a service):
      - Infrastructure (consumer most responsibility)
      - platform (middle ground)
      - software (cloud provider most responsibility)

      *Service model determines responsibility of:
        - Operating systems
        - Network controls
        - Applications
        - Identity and infrastructure

      *Cloud provider always responible for:
        - physical datacenter, phys. network, phys. hosts

      *Consumer always responsible for:
        - Information/data stored in cloud, allowed devices, accounts/IDs of people, services, devices within org.

  **Define cloud models

    *Cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. 
      - Three main cloud models: private, public, hybrid. 

    * Private cloud 
      - Cloud used by a single entity.
      - Provides greater control for the company/IT dep. 
      - But greater costs, fewer benefits of public cloud deploy. 
      - May be hosted from on-site datacenter or dedicated off-site datacenter
        - Even by a third party datacenter. 
      
    * Public cloud
      - Built, controlled, maintained by third party cloud provider. 
      - Accessible by anyone that wants to purchase cloud services. 
      - Key difference between private and public clouds: general public availability.

    * Hybrid cloud 
      - Computing environ. that uses both public and private clouds: inter-connected environment. 
      - Can be used to allow private cloud to surge for increased, temp. demand by deploying public cloud resources.
      - Can provice extra layer security -> Users can choose which services to keep in public cloud, which in private. 

    * Multi-cloud 
      - User chooses multiple public cloud prov. for different reasons (like different features bijv.)
      
    * Azure Arc
      - Set of technologies that helps managing your cloud environ. (for all models)
    
    * Azure VMware Solution
      - Lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure.

**Describe consumption-based model

  * Capital expenditure vs operational expenditure: kopen (niet dynamisch) vs huren (dynamisch in up of downscalen)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** Describe core architectural components of Azure 

  * Accounts 
      Subscriptions
        Resource groups
          Resources 

** Azure physical infrastructure 
    
  *Physical infrastructure
    - Datacenters around the world (Azure is a global cloud provider)
      - Grouped in Azure Regions/Azure Availability Zones
        -> Designed to help achieve resilience and reliability
    
    * Regions
      - Is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one or more datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network 
        - When deploying a resource you need to choose region. 
        *Some VM features or services only available in certain regions. Some global features don't need regions. 
    
    * Availability zones 
      - Physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. 
        - One or more datacenters equipped with independant power, cooling, networking. 
        - A. zones set up to be an isolation boundary. 
        - Zones connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks. 
        * To ensure resilience, minimum three separate A. zones are present in A. zone-enabled regions. 
          Not all regions currently support A. zones.
