YC notes - 2 april 2024

**ISTQB 

  *Review Process 
    - informal or formal 
        - formaliteit hangt af van verschillende factoren.

    *Formal review:
      - author: ontwikkelaar van product

    *Review types: goal is to uncover defects 
      - Informal
      - Walkthrough: scribe verplicht
      - Technical review: reviewers are tech. peers indiv. prep. is required. scribe verplicht (ideal not author). logs and reviews are produced.
      - Inspection: defined process, clearly defined roles mandatory, specied entry and exit criteria. author no additional roles. reports and logs are produced, metrics data collected > used to improved. 

      *Applying review techniques
        - Ad hoc
        - Checklist-based
        - Scenarios and dry runs
        - Role-based
        - Perpective-based

      *Organizational Success (!)
        - Each review: clear objectives
        - Applied review types: suitable to achieve objectives, appriopriate to the type and level of software WP. 
        - Review techniques are suitable. 

        - Adequate time and adequete notice to prepare for review contribute to success. (!)
        - Management supports review process. 

      *People-related success factors
        - Right people are involved. 
        - Testers seen as valued reviewers.
        - Adequate time and attention to detail dedicated by particip.
        - Small chunks
        - Objective handling of defects 
        - well-managed meeting
        - Trust atmosphere
        - No weird behaviors (hostile, boredom)
        - Adequate training is provided
        - Learning and process improvement culture promoted. 

      Question 4 (?): B, in andere antwoorden zitten elementen van dynamic testing in. 

      *Test design techniques 
        - black box: behaviour-based, kijken naar gedrag (func. en non-func.), kijken naar input en output, maar niet naar interne structuur (!). Coverage based on items tested and techniques
        - white box: kijken naar code, architec. interne structure
        - experience based: combined w/ white and box, test tech op zichzelf, gebaseerd op XP van devs, testers, users, stakeholders (environment, likely defects, distribution clusters)

      *Black box techniques (kijken naar gedrag):
        - Equivalence partitioning: 
            - 
        - Boundary value analysis: 
            - partition is ordered 
            - boundary values(min max van grens)
            - om te kijken of grens gevallen goed gedragen
